I use the JSbin tool to do the course, as Dan Abramov does.

The first three videos are the Redux principles:
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Single source of truth
The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
2. State is read-only
The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
3. Changes are made with pure functions
To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
